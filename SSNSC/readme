Spectral-Spatial Nearest Subspace Classifier (SSNSC) method is a kind of representation-based method. 
The SSNSC method is proposed, inspired by the geometric interpretation of the Nearest Subspace Classifier (NSC) method. NSC is a simple classifier
that works on the assumption that samples from the same class approximately lie on the same subspace. 
Based on this assumption, the NSC method analyzes the closeness between the test sample and the space spanned by the within-class training samples. 
Then, the label of the test sample is assigned to the closest class. However, NSC only considers spectral information and neglects spatial information.
In addition to the assumption in the NSC method, we add another assumption that spatially adjacent pixels quite likely belong to the same class.
By combining these two assumptions, we conclude that spatially adjacent pixels must approximately lie on the same subspace as well.
Based on these assumptions, we propose the spectral-spatial nearest subspace classification (SSNSC) approach as a generic classification framework
that performs classification by analyzing  the closeness between the subspace spanned by the samples used for spatial information and the subspace
spanned by the within-class training samples. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is used to measure the closeness between these two subspaces.
