# TCRL: Triple Contrastive Representation Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification With Noisy Labels
The paper has been published on **IEEE TGRS**, it is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172348).

# Dependency

* python>=3.8, torch >= 1.9
* nni
* scipy, sklearn
* addict, tqdm
* matplotlib

# Usage
* Download the dataset from the [website](https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes), and then modify the **data path** in 'HSI_dataset.py'->'load_dataset(Dataset):'
* Run 'TCRL_main.py' for training and test. The demo is conducted on the UP dataset with 52 clean samples and 24 noisy samples under sym noise type. The results can be found in folder 'log/UPXXXXX'.
* Other datasets: open the 'configs --> tcrl.py', then modify the following five parameters 'dataset/input_channel/num_classes/train_size/percent', and run 'TCRL_main.py'.

Note: Some results are provided in the folder 'TCRL-result'. Our method has been tested on both Windows and Linux platforms, and the results may vary slightly due to differences in the system and GPU.

Our code is based on [Co-learning](https://github.com/chengtan9907/Co-learning-Learning-from-noisy-labels-with-self-supervision), and the authors are very grateful to Ph.D. Tan for sharing the code.
